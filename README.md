# 👋 Hi, I’m Jihar Gifari

📚 I’m currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at Leeds Beckett University, United Kingdom, where I am enhancing my skills in data science, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making.

💼 I have valuable industry experience, having worked as a Data Scientist at Shopee International Indonesia, where I specialized in predictive analytics, optimizing budget allocation, and crafting personalized marketing strategies.

🏢 I've also contributed significantly as a Data Analyst at Bahana Sekuritas, leading projects to enhance customer analytics and sentiment analysis.

📊 In addition to my professional roles, I'm actively engaged as a Data Science Tutor at Shift Academy, with over 1000 hours of teaching experience in data science, machine learning, and data analysis.

👯 I’m open to collaborations in the fields of data science and machine learning.

💬 Feel free to ask me about regression, classification, clustering, recommender systems, or any other machine learning techniques.
